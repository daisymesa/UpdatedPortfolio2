   1) If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
	    Semantic HTML refers to writing your HTML in such a way that it becomes meaningful.  For example, there are tags that we can use, such as <section></section> or <header></header> that allow someone who doesn't know about HTML to have an idea of what it refers to.

	    Some HTML is not semantic, but instead presentational.  Some examples include <div></div> and <span></span>.  These types of tags are used when our need is not in the meaning, but on the style and layout of that part of the page only.

	    It is important to use semantic HTML everywhere that it is possible, as it allows for our webpage to have greater accessibility and makes it more readable for others.

    5) Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
    	Git is valuable to a team of developers because it allows everyone to share the work that they do, to work simultaneously on different parts of a project without affecting each other's code, and allows them to review each other's work/changes to code. It therfore helps the project be completed more smoothly and efficiently, while also providing safeguards along the way.
